It was a visceral expulsion, a cascade of putrid, ethereal gore that splattered against the chamber walls before dissolving into nothingness. Above me, I felt the mansion sigh, a collective exhale of ancient grief finally released. Eleanor’s spectral form, now luminous and at peace, smiled at me before fading into a gentle light, her child’s ethereal laughter a sweet echo. The darkness retreated, replaced by a profound, if still mournful, silence. The pact was broken.",

I felt an unimaginable pain as tendrils of pure darkness pierced my flesh, not tearing, but dissolving me from within. My body convulsed, my bones grinding against each other as my form distorted, elongating, twisting into grotesque parodies of human limbs. A searing agony consumed my eyes, then my mouth, as black ichor erupted from every orifice. My screams were choked, dissolving into gurgles as my throat constricted, filling with the vile substance. The final sensation was not death, but a horrific absorption, my essence folding into the demon's boundless void, my consciousness fragmenting into countless echoes of torment.
