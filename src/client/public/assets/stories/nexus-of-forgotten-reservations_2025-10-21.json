The eerie silence envelops you, a profound quietude shattered only by distant cries that resonate like the pleas of stars collapsing into black holes. A spectral clerk behind the counter regards you with eyes like abyssal depths. 'Welcome to the nexus,' it intones, voice a whisper from forgotten realms. 'Your reservation awaits in the fabric of the unseen.'
