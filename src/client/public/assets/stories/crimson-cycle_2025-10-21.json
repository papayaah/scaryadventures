You are lying on a cold concrete floor. In front of you, a large reinforced viewport on the far wall reveals a gigantic, blood-red moon dominating the sky. To your left, a flickering, old computer console with a green screen showing garbled text. A dimly lit corridor stretches away into darkness on the right.",
