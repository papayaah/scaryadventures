I held a single, unlit candle in my hand. A whisper, like dry leaves skittering on stone, seemed to ask why I had come. I didn't have an answer, only a deep, pulling ache in my chest.",
      "image_prompt": "My hands are visible at the bottom of the frame, one holding an old, unlit white candle. I am looking through the bars of a tall, ornate, and rusted iron gate into a misty cemetery filled with crooked headstones. Swirling smoke clings to the ground.

It swirled around the ankles of a marble statue aheadâ€”a saint, its face worn smooth by a century of rain. Its stone eyes seemed to follow me. From behind the statue, a spectral figure drifted into view, a man in old-fashioned clothes, his form indistinct, his face a mask of sorrow.",

The smoke was thinner, but it clung to the ground in strange, shifting patterns. Spectral figures, little more than smudges of light, drifted between the graves, moving without purpose. They seemed lost.",

The name was gone, worn away. At the base of the headstone sat a small, silver locket, miraculously untarnished. The spirit's whisper was clear now. 'Not mine... but she is waiting.' I picked up the locket. It was cold, and felt heavy with sadness.",

Inside, a tall, imposing spectral figure stood guard over a freshly disturbed grave. It was not sorrowful like the others. It was angry. Its form was dark, less a ghost and more a solid piece of night. It turned its empty gaze on me, and on the locket in my hand.",
      "image_prompt": "I am looking into a family plot surrounded by a low iron fence. In the center stands a tall, dark, spectral figure, more shadow than light, with a menacing posture. It stands before a prominent headstone bearing the name 'Blackwood'. My hand is visible at the bottom, clutching a silver locket tightly.

Then, a soft light bloomed from the locket, pushing back the smoke. The dark figure dissolved, and all around me, the spectral forms paused. They looked up, as if seeing the sky for the first time, and then faded into peaceful nonexistence. I finally understood. The debt was not of money, but of memory.",

When it touched my forehead, my memories unspooled. My name, my life, my reason for being there... all of it drained away into the cold earth. I felt my body grow light, my form indistinct. I was just another sorrowful shape, doomed to wander the marble garden.",
