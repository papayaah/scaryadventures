A chill, more profound than mere autumn air, slithered into my bones, a cold caress from the edifice itself. I was the last of my line, drawn by an irresistible, morbid curiosity to this place of family legend and whispered damnation.

A child, sickly and dying, could be saved, but at a terrible price: the devotion of the family line, a pact with a 'Shadowed Lord' to claim new souls. The manor itself was the nexus, consecrated by blood and fear, a prison for lost souls and a gateway for something infernal.
