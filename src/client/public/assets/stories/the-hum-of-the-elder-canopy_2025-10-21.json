A surge of raw electrical energy erupts from its wound, lashing back at the forest itself. The creature shrieks, an unheard sound of agony. It dissolves into pure static, absorbed back into the very ground. For a moment, the forest's hum falters. You have banished a fragment, but the whole remains.",

You are seen mid-action, striking a monstrous, multi-limbed creature with a makeshift weapon. The creature is dissolving into streaks of static electricity and dark smoke from the point of impact. The forest around is visibly recoiling, branches twisting in alarm. Lightning flashes intensely, highlighting the raw energy.",
