Spectral figures flicker at the edges of your vision, translucent and desperate. They pull at your senses, at your will, trying to merge with you. You feel a profound, aching sorrow, an endless longing for release. They want to absorb you, to drag you into their eternal void, to find peace in shared oblivion.",
