      "text": "I screamed a curse of defiance and snatched a heavy wrench from the floor. I swung it wildly, a frantic, desperate act against their placid silence. The first one I struck went down without a sound, a spray of dark blood upon the tiles. But they were a tide, and I was a single stone. They flowed over me, their hands gentle but firm, their collective weight immense. The tools of their harvest, the rebar knives and obsidian shears, found me. My final moments were a flurry of methodical, painless cuts, my blood watering the sigils on the tracks.",

Looking straight down on a chaotic scene where a single figure is being overwhelmed by a crowd of cultists. Blood is splattered across the floor and the figure is being dismembered by numerous hands holding crude blades.",

A sense of peace, profound and absolute, settled over me. I was tired of running. I was tired of being a weed in their garden. They led me to the altar of the rail and laid me down gently. I felt the cool touch of the wire as they wrapped it around my limbs. I closed my eyes and listened to the lullaby, eagerly awaiting my planting.",

A lone figure lies peacefully and willingly on a subway track covered in glowing red symbols. Cultists are gently wrapping their body in copper wires, their movements slow and reverent.",
