A cold shock. My limbs are not my own. The whispers stop. A new voice, ancient and cruel, speaks from my own mouth, though my lips do not move. *This vessel will serve. We will walk again.* I am a prisoner in my own skull, a spectator to the horrors my hands will now perform.",

I am a priest who lost his faith. I am all of them. I am none of them. I laugh and I weep and I scream, my voice a cacophony of a thousand stolen voices. They find me days later, curled in a service tunnel, babbling about a heart that beats beneath the world. My mind is a shattered station, all its trains running on the wrong tracks, forever.",
