The tin soldiers and teddy bears from the stairs swarm behind you, blocking all retreat. A grand, ornate music box in the room's center begins to play a distorted, tinny lullaby, and the dolls' heads snap towards you in unison, their limbs twitching.

You fall, tumbling into a vast, moldy cellar. A low, guttural groaning sound echoes from the oppressive gloom, but before it can materialize into a threat, you spot a heavy, bolted door on the far wall.
