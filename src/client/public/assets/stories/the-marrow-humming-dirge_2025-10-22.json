A deep, sub-audible hum pulsed from the frozen earth, a vibration that promised dissolution. Before them, the main gate stood, a lattice of rusted iron impossibly heavy and bound by a lock green with age. The grimoire in their satchel felt like a tumor, heavy with forbidden knowledge. The Dirge had begun.",

Piles of disinterred bones, yellowed and stained with earth, surged like a breaking wave. They fused with wet cracks and snaps, assembling into a multi-limbed horror of clicking femurs and grasping phalanges. It was a swarm given singular, hateful purpose, and it scrambled towards them with the unnatural speed of a collapsing star.",

Here, the tombstones leaned at impossible angles, etched with looping sigils that seemed to writhe in the candlelight. A whisper, not of air but of stone grinding on stone, entered their mind. It spoke without language, a direct transmission of dread. The hum was not a summons to power, but the resonant frequency of a cage's bars. They were not opening a door; they were becoming a key for that which was locked away.",

The dead clawed from their graves, skeletons draped in rotted shrouds, their bones glowing with an internal, ember-like light. They moved like marionettes, their heads lolling. In the center of the ring, the earth had collapsed into a pit of roiling, liquid darkness. The final incantation screamed from the page, demanding a sacrifice of will and flesh to complete the circuit.",

The Marrow-Humming Dirge ceased. The cold, a palpable entity moments before, vanished, replaced by a simple, mundane chill. The silence was absolute. They fled the Blackwood Ossuary, leaving the gate to that other place closed. But the memory of the hum would forever nestle behind their eyes, a promise of the vast, hungry emptiness between worlds.",

The liquid shadow surged upwards, a living tsunami that enveloped them. The pain was an eternity. Their flesh was unmade, boiled away and rendered down to constituent atoms. Their skeleton, now glowing with the same hellish orange light, stepped forward to join the silent, endless procession. Their consciousness became a single, screaming note in a choir that will sing until the stars die.",

The silver athame sparked against the ancient stone. A sound like a dying galaxy shrieked from the pit. The hum inverted, becoming a null-frequency that shattered the animate dead into heaps of bone dust, their inner light extinguished. The oppressive presence vanished. They had stared into the abyss and slammed the door shut.",
