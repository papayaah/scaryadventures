A chill, like the touch of winter’s spectral hand, brushes your skin, and the air is thick with the scent of dust, aged wood, and something faintly metallic, like old blood. Whispers, thin as spider silk, unfurl around you, indistinct murmurs that seem to emanate from the very furniture. Before you, a grand, ornate grandfather clock stands sentinel at the room's center, its pendulum eerily still, its brass face gleaming with a malign intelligence. To your left, a vast, dusty tapestry on the far wall seems to subtly ripple, the figures woven into its ancient fabric shifting with an unnerving, almost imperceptible life.",

From a slender crack in the wood near its base, a gnarled, skeletal hand, delicate yet strong, emerges with agonizing slowness, its bone-white fingers twitching, beckoning you closer. The whispers intensify, weaving themselves into a dizzying chorus that seems to echo from your own skull: \"*Come... let time unravel...*\"",

A cold gust of wind, smelling of damp earth and rust, sweeps through the air, carrying faint, disembodied screams that seem to emanate from the very fabric.

A collection of bronze busts begin to moan, their hollow eyes weeping trails of dark ichor. If you faced the tapestry, the skeletal canine now fully manifests, a monstrous creature of ragged cloth and bone, snarling and bounding towards you. The whispers, no longer indistinct, coalesce into a roaring gale of malevolent intent, a chorus demanding your presence.
