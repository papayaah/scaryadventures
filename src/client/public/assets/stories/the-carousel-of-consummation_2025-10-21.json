A twisted archway of wrought iron, resembling skeletal fingers, looms overhead, its gates ajar as if beckoning a final, desperate guest. Beyond, an unnatural silence hangs heavy, broken only by the distant, disembodied cries that seem to ripple through the very air, too close to be animal, too elongated to be human. A pervasive sense of dread, like a cold hand, clenches your heart, yet an undeniable, morbid curiosity compels you forward. The forgotten world within promises a truth more profound than mere desolation.",

A low, throbbing hum emanates from its corroded core, a sound that vibrates through the earth beneath your feet, almost a pulse. Upon the cracked, uneven ground around its base, faint symbols are daubed in a reddish-brown pigment, ancient and sinister.

A sickly, pulsing light, emanating from some unseen source behind the altar, illuminates the scene with a ghastly, flickering glow, causing shadows to dance like frenzied spirits.

Each reflection is subtly different, some grinning impossibly wide, others weeping silently. The rhythmic thumping from beneath the ground grows louder here, resonating through the glass and floorboards, a monstrous heartbeat. Mysterious whispers slither from the shadows between the mirrors, too faint to discern, yet rich with malice.
